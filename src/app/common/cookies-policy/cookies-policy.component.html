​
<p>These are cookies that we use to remember which pages you’ve viewed (including which adverts you’ve been shown) on our website, and to show you adverts that we think might be of interest to you, based on your browsing history on our website.

<p>Ceasefire Industries Pvt. Limited partners’ marketing and advertising cookies:</p>
​
<p>These cookies are used by other companies we work with to deliver you relevant advertising on our website and on other websites. They are sometimes called “third party cookies” because they are set by other companies when you browse our website, rather than by us. These companies use cookies to build a profile of you, based on your browsing on our website, their own websites and other websites that they work with, and which adverts you’ve seen and clicked on our website and on other websites. They may also combine this with other information they collect about you from other sources. They use these profiles to show you relevant adverts, both on our website and on other websites. These companies may track your browsing across multiple devices, and combine your browsing on multiple devices into a single profile that is used to deliver relevant adverts to you on all of those devices. They may use a number of different methods to work out whether multiple devices appear to be used by you, including matching information about your devices, browsing activity and geo-location.</p>
